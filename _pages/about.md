Hi I'm Matt - a python developer, and budding data scientist currently based out of Raleigh, NC.

Although my undergraduate background is rooted in Biology, I fell in love with data analytics and programming after graduation.

As a Marketing Scientist at Valassis Digital, I build and maintain databases (Hive and Postgres), develop code to streamline workflows across teams, and use analytics to measure the performance of digital marketing campaigns.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, working out, reading, and traveling.
